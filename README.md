# Python Programming for Social Science (EPPS/GISC 4317/6317)

## Course Overview

This course, taught by Dr. Bryan Chastain at The University of Texas at Dallas, introduces computer programming skills and their application in social sciences using Python. Topics covered include fundamental programming syntax, control structures, numerical and scientific computation, visualization, and social data analytics. Students are expected to programmatically design and build projects related to social sciences.

## Midterm Project

### Objectives
Your midterm will have three components spanning the material covered thus far in class.

1. **Real Estate**
   - **Description**: You are a real estate agent who has clients interested in buying a new house in Collin County near UTD. It is a hot market, so you want to find existing homes that meet your clientsâ€™ criteria and then ask the owners if they are interested in selling.
   - **Requirements**:
     - Single-family house (state_code='A1')
     - At least 1500 sq ft of living area
     - Market value between $250,000 and $350,000
     - Located in the area zoned to Aldridge Elementary (CAMPNAME='ALDRIDGE EL')
   - **Undergraduates**: Write a Python script to print the count of houses that meet the criteria and list all addresses.
   - **Graduates**: Write a Python script to prompt the user for each criterion and print the count and list of addresses. Ensure valid input for living area and cost.

2. **Coordinate Conversion**
   - **Description**: Write a script to convert Decimal Degree (DD) latitude/longitude coordinates into Degree-Minute-Second (DMS) coordinates.
   - **Requirements**:
     - Accepts input coordinates in DD format and outputs them in DMS.
     - Returns an error message for invalid coordinates.
   - **Graduates**: Prompt the user to run another conversion when finished.

3. **File Manipulation**
   - **Description**: Write a Python script that opens a CSV file and prints out the contents with tabs delimiting the columns for proper spacing.
   - **Undergraduates**: Ask the user for a CSV file to read/print.
   - **Graduates**: Ask the user for a directory to search for CSVs in, and print contents for each CSV found.

## Final Project

### Description
The final project involves creating a comprehensive data analysis and visualization dashboard.

1. **Main Program**: `Data Analysis and Visualization.ipynb`
   - **Description**: The first half of the code is for testing and experimentation, and the second half contains the full version of the dashboard code and a segmented version of the dashboard code.
   
2. **Geo Data Filter**: `geo data filter EA.ipynb` located in `geo data/geo data east asia/`
   - **Description**: This program cleans and merges all geo events data.

3. **Data Files**:
   - `geo data` folder contains the geo events data and the data cleaning program.
   - `samsung financial` folder contains the Samsung data and the data cleaning program.
   - `TSMC financial` folder contains the TSMC data and the data cleaning program.

### Requirements
- Create a data analysis and visualization dashboard using Python.
- Clean and merge data from various sources.
- Use visualization tools to present the data effectively.
